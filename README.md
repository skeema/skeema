Skeema is a tool for managing MySQL tables and schema changes in a declarative fashion using pure SQL. It provides a CLI tool allowing you to:

* Export CREATE TABLE statements to the filesystem, for tracking in a repo (git, hg, svn, etc)
* Diff changes in the schema repo against live DBs to automatically generate DDL
* Manage multiple environments (e.g. dev, staging, prod) and keep them in sync with ease
* Configure use of online schema change tools, such as pt-online-schema-change, for performing ALTERs
* Convert non-online migrations from frameworks like Rails or Django into online schema changes in production

Skeema supports a pull-request-based workflow for schema change submission, review, and execution. This permits your team to manage schema changes in exactly the same way as you manage code changes.

## Downloading

Pre-built `skeema` binaries for Linux and macOS can be downloaded from the [releases](https://github.com/skeema/skeema/releases) page.

## Compiling

Compiling from scratch requires the [Go programming language toolchain](https://golang.org/dl/), version 1.9 or higher.

To download, build from master, and install (or upgrade) Skeema, run:

`go get -u github.com/skeema/skeema`

## Status

Skeema is generally available, having reached the v1 release milestone in July 2018. Prior to that, it was in public beta since October 2016.

The `skeema` binary is supported on macOS and Linux. For now, it cannot be compiled on Windows.

Tagged releases are tested against the following databases, all running on Linux:

* MySQL 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 8.0
* Percona Server 5.6, 5.7
* MariaDB 10.1, 10.2, 10.3

Outside of a tagged release, every commit to the master branch is automatically tested against MySQL 5.6 and 5.7.

A few uncommon MySQL features -- such as partitioning, fulltext indexes, spatial types, virtual columns -- are not yet supported. Skeema is able to *create* or *drop* tables using these features, but not *alter* them. The output of `skeema diff` and `skeema push` clearly displays when this is the case. You may still make such alters directly/manually (outside of Skeema), and then update the corresponding CREATE TABLE files via `skeema pull`.
