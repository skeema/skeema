# Tables using generated columns -- split into a separate file due to only
# being tested/supported in recent versions.

# This file is only used in MariaDB 10.2+; it's separated from the MySQL test
# due to MariaDB not supporting NOT NULL in generated cols, and not supporting
# 4-byte characters in generation expressions.
# Also this package doesn't support MariaDB 10.1's alternative syntax for
# generated columns, so it is excluded from related tests.
