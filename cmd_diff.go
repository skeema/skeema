filesystem.

You may optionally pass an environment name as a CLI option. This will affect
which section of .skeema config files is used for processing. For example,
running ` + "`" + `skeema diff staging` + "`" + ` will apply config directives from the
[staging] section of config files, as well as any sectionless directives at the
top of the file. If no environment name is supplied, the default is
"production".

The ` + "`" + `skeema diff` + "`" + ` command is equivalent to ` + "`" + `skeema push --dry-run` + "`" + `.

An exit code of 0 will be returned if no differences were found, 1 if some
differences were found, or 2+ if an error occurred.`
